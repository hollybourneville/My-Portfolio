        <h2>Plastic Waste Is Killing Our Marine Life</h2>
        <p>Did you know that plastic kills around 1 million sea birds and 100,000 marine creatures annually? Marine life can either become entangled in our rubbish or mistake it for food which causes fatal internal blockages or malnutrition.</p>
        <p>Even when plastic breaks down, it breaks down into polymers, micro fragments and toxic chemicals that can still harm marine life and in turn us.</p>
        <p>A recent study found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish which ultimatley leads to plastic ingestion in humans.</p>

        <p><span>How does plastic get into the ocean and where does it end up?</span></p>
        <p>About 20% of plastic litter in our oceans is comprised of fishing gear and other materials lost at sea by accident however the majority of it comes from land.</p>
        <p>Most plastic that ends up in the sea comes from littering and bad waste management systems. Many parts of the world don't have the infrastructure or systems required to deal with waste including Ghana, Africa. In Ghana the Waste Management Department is currently capable of collecting only 60% of the waste generated daily. The rest is dumped in open spaces, surface drains, and into bodies of water. </p>
